This GitHub project is a collaboration between a couple of Danish public agencies on a common development and 
operation platform for modern web applications using cloud technologies. 

Here you can find and update documentation during the first initial phases of the project. 

Remember all information is public, so don't put sensitive information in the documentation. 

Documentation is published at https://digst.github.io/cloud on commit via GitHub Pages.

Files in the `/docs` folder are either 
 - sent through GitHub Pages' Jekyll (.md files)
 - outputted by manually running `compile.sh` using [BikeShed](https://tabatkins.github.io/bikeshed/) on files in the root directory (.html) 
 - images exported manually from [Archi](https://www.archimatetool.com/) using Archimate files in this repository (.svg)
